/*	Java Program to show the difference between map vs flatMap
  map() is used to transform one Stream into another by applying a function on each element, 
  and flatMap() does both transformations as well as flattening.
  The flatMap() function can take a Stream of List and return a Stream of values combined from all those lists.
  In the example below, we have collected the result in a List 
  but you can also print them using the forEach() method of Java 8.

		List<Integer> length = fruits.stream().map(f->f.length()).collect(Collectors.toList());

/*Why flat a Stream?
 Itâ€™s challenging to process a Stream containing more than one level, 
 like Stream<String[]> or Stream<List<LineItem>> or Stream<Stream<String>>. 
 And we flat the 2 levels Stream into one level, like Stream<String> or Stream<LineItem>, 
 so that we can easily loop the Stream and process it.

 Below is a 2d array, and we can use Arrays.stream or Stream.of to convert it into a Stream,
  and it produces a Stream of String[] or Stream<String[]>.
